        title: 'The Black Duchess, <i>1797</i>',
        description: 'Goya  painted Doña María de Pilar Teresa Cayetana de Silva Álvarez de Toledo  otherwise known as the Duchess of Alba. She was known for her infamous beauty. The Duchess is wearing the popular maja style of dress. Maja or the male Majo were usually members of lower class who popularized a style of fanciful dress, manners and behavior. Their style of lace, full skirts, and dramatic fans were eventually adopted by the upper class. Goya focused on depicting the majas in his early career and played a part in popularizing the style for the upper class.<br/> <br/>The background of the work is a dreamy transparent landscape of her  estate in Sanlúcar.<br/><br/>Goya shows a close relationship with the Duchess with the words, solo Goya ("only Goya") written in the sand, and her rings read "Alba" and "Goya."',

With the help of the gods and the sorceress Medea, Jason was able to take the fleece from a grove protected by a dragon. Here, with Athena beside him, he reaches for the fleece. A companion prepares to board the ship.<br/></br>The basis of the legend of the Golden Fleece is probably the ancient practice of extracting alluvial gold by causing the deposits in a stream to wash over a fleece, thereby catching the gold-bearing material in the curly pelt.',
